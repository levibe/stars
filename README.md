Simple star background generator

## Why
Needed a simple background on which to overlay a planet image.

## How to use
Just load `index.html` in your browser. Reload as many times as you like.

## To improve
- Introduce color variation to the stars (slight blue or yellow tones)
- Come up with a way to cluster stars for more of a galaxy look

Feel free to embrace and extend!
